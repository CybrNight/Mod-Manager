# Mod-Manager
Universal mod manager written in python.

After being annoyed that Nexus Mod Manager wasn't written universally (still have no idea why), and because I didn't want to use someone else's code I made this.
A glorified copy paste button that works fairly well. For now Mac and Linux download and run from source. Working on Mac and Linux executables. I may add more specifc implementation for certain things later

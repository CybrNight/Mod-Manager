# Mod-Manager
Universal mod manager written in python.

After being annoyed that Nexus Mod Manager wasn't written universally (still have no idea why). And because I didn't want to use someone else's code I made this.
A glorified copy paste button that works fairly well. Download latest binary from releases or just clone the repo and run the latest source. Releases tab may be updated infrequently if ever :).

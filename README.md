# Mod-Manager
Universal mod manager written in python.

After being annoyed that Nexus Mod Manager wasn't written universally (still have no idea why), and because I didn't want to use someone else's code I made this.
A glorified copy paste button that works fairly well. For now Mac and Linux download and run from source. Working on Mac and Linux executables. I may add more specifc implementation for certain games later. 

##Compiling yourself
If you want to compile this yourself instead of running from source if the releases tab isn't updated or whatever else

###This is for Windows only. Mac/Linux need to edit the setup.py file and it should work

1. Install Python 3.6
2. Download latest commit version and extract
3. Open CMD
4. Run python setup.py build

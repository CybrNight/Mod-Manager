# Mod-Manager
Universal mod manager written in python.

After being annoyed that Nexus Mod Manager wasn't written universally (still have no idea why), and because I didn't want to use someone else's code I made this.
A glorified copy paste button that works fairly well. There are compiled version available, but the source 

Running from source is as simple as running main.py from Terminal/CMD or what have you

##Compiling yourself
If you want to compile this yourself instead of running from source

###New and improved setup file for Mac compiling

1. Install Python 3.6
2. Download latest commit version and extract
3. Open CMD/Terminal
4. Navigate to extracted source and run the setup file for your platform (ex. python3.6 setup.py setup_mac.py)
5. Build should be saved in build folder in root project directory
